# ITI110 Deep Leaning Project

## Problem Description

Land Cover Classification of Satellite Images
using U-Net Convolutional Neural Networks

## Project Structure

This project has 3 phases: Part A, B and C. 

* Part A: Preparing Data (done by Amos)
* Part B1: U-Net baseline model (done by Amos and Song Kwee)
* Part B2: U-Net VGG16 U-Net model (done by Mridul)
* Part B3: U-Net Resnet50 U-Net model (done by Aung)
* Part B4: U-Net EfficientNet U-Net model (done by Aung)

## Project Summary

We completed 4 models (base U-Net, VGG16 U-Net, Resnet50 U-Net and EfficientNetB0 U-Net, and ensembled the first 3 models.

The ensembled model achieved a validation accuracy of 79.3%.
